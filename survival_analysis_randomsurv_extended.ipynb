    "Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a wildfire ignites, emergency managers face an impossible question with incomplete information. Which fires will reach populated areas? How quickly? And which communities should prepare first?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This year's WiDS Global Datathon challenges participants to build survival models that answer these questions using only the earliest signals available. Your task is to predict the probability that a wildfire will threaten an evacuation zone within 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, drawing on data from just the first five hours after ignition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The goal is not a single prediction but a calibrated forecast across multiple time horizons. Emergency responders need both urgency rankings (which fires demand immediate attention) and probability estimates they can trust when making high-stakes decisions about evacuations, resource deployment, and public alerts."
